Need to extract photos from PhotoRecall database files
In 2017 Rob Riddel wrote an article about extracting photos from a Photorecall database.  https://robriddle.io/extracting-images-from-photorecall-deluxe-files/
Towards the end of the article he confirms success.  However, I have no idea how to do what he describes.  Can anyone help me extract my photos?
